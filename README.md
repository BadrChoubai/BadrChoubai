# Hi. My name is Badr Choubai.

This year I've found a lot of joy in things other than programming and haven't dedicated a lot of time to projects, opting instead to focus on school.

## Quick Bits
- My personal website doesn't appear on google, hence my favorite line of markup.
  ```html
    <meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">
  ```
- My favorite tools: IntelliJ & WebStorm, Alacritty, `nvim`, `tmux`, `brew`
- My favorite programming languages: JavaScript and Python

### Book's I've Learned From
- *Thinking in Systems: A Primer* by Donella H. Meadows
- *Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life* by Nassim Nicholas Taleb
- *The Plague* by Albert Camus
- *Man's Search for Meaning* by Viktor E. Frankl
