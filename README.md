I'm a Moroccan-American software engineer from Aurora, Colorado. My name—Badr (بدر)—means "The Full Moon" in Arabic.
I take pride in it. In becoming a professional engineer, I've found that I really enjoy learning new things and having
to struggle through a problem to solve it.

Lately, I've been starting to learn Go, developing small applications with it.
Along with continuing to grow my knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.

When I'm not writing code, I like to drink coffee, read a book, and hang out
with friends. When I need to clear my head, I go for a run or listen to music.
For about two years, I've been a running much more seriously and started to sign up for
more events. This year, I'll be running my first last-man standing run, in
Ouray, Colorado. When I can, I'd like to run the Marrakech Marathon.
