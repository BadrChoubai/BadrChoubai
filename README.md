I'm a software engineer from Aurora, Colorado, passionate about building and learning. Lately, I’ve been expanding my skill set by learning Go, diving into Docker and Kubernetes, and working on personal projects.

Outside of coding, I stay active—whether it's running, hiking, or the occasional climbing session. When I'm bored I like to read, and sometimes I journal. What I love most though is being with friends and family, the ones who remind me of my _Why_.

**Some opinions I have:**

- I'm not a fan of working remotely, I think it's lonely and makes relationships feel transactional.
- We should tax the rich—financially and socially. They should feel the pressure to act more responsibly.
